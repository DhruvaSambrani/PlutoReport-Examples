# Examples Repo for PlutoReport

This repo is for examples of the [PlutoReport.jl](/dhruvasambrani/PlutoReport.jl) package in julia.

**Note:** These examples may be using older versions of PlutoReport, and may not have the newest features in the package! So the package is definitely _better_ than the examples!
