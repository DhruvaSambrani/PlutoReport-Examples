	abstract = {Classical first-passage times under restart are used in a wide variety of models, yet the quantum version of the problem still misses key concepts. We study the quantum first detected passage time under restart protocol using a monitored quantum walk. The restart strategy eliminates the problem of dark states, i.e. cases where the particle is not detected at all, while maintaining the ballistic propagation which is important for fast search. We find profound effects of quantum oscillations on the restart problem, namely a type of instability of the mean detection time, and optimal restart times that form staircases, with sudden drops as the rate of sampling is modified. In the absence of restart and in the Zeno limit, the detection of the walker is not possible and we examine how restart overcomes this well-known problem, showing that the optimal restart time becomes insensitive to the sampling period.},

	abstract = {Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks consist of the physical and/or functional interactions between the proteins of an organism. Since the biophysical and high-throughput methods used to form PPI networks are expensive, time-consuming, and often contain inaccuracies, the resulting networks are usually incomplete. In order to infer missing interactions in these networks, we propose a novel class of link prediction methods based on continuous-time classical and quantum random walks. In the case of quantum walks, we examine the usage of both the network adjacency and Laplacian matrices for controlling the walk dynamics. We define a score function based on the corresponding transition probabilities and perform tests on four real-world PPI datasets. Our results show that continuous-time classical random walks and quantum walks using the network adjacency matrix can successfully predict missing protein-protein interactions, with performance rivalling the state of the art.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14023},
	abstract = {Given a random function \$f\$ with domain \$[2{\textasciicircum}n]\$ and codomain \$[2{\textasciicircum}m]\$, with \$m {\textbackslash}geq n\$, a collision of \$f\$ is a pair of distinct inputs with the same image. Collision finding is an ubiquitous problem in cryptanalysis, and it has been well studied using both classical and quantum algorithms. Indeed, the quantum query complexity of the problem is well known to be \${\textbackslash}Theta(2{\textasciicircum}\{m/3\})\$, and matching algorithms are known for any value of \$m\$. The situation becomes different when one is looking for multiple collision pairs. Here, for \$2{\textasciicircum}k\$ collisions, a query lower bound of \${\textbackslash}Theta(2{\textasciicircum}\{(2k+m)/3\})\$ was shown by Liu and Zhandry (EUROCRYPT{\textasciitilde}2019). A matching algorithm is known, but only for relatively small values of \$m\$, when many collisions exist. In this paper, we improve the algorithms for this problem and, in particular, extend the range of admissible parameters where the lower bound is met. Our new method relies on a chained quantum walk algorithm, which might be of independent interest. It allows to extract multiple solutions of an MNRS-style quantum walk, without having to recompute it entirely: after finding and outputting a solution, the current state is reused as the initial state of another walk. As an application, we improve the quantum sieving algorithms for the shortest vector problem (SVP), with a complexity of \$2{\textasciicircum}\{0.2563d + o(d)\}\$ instead of the previous \$2{\textasciicircum}\{0.2570d + o(d)\}\$.},

	abstract = {The quantization of the PageRank algorithm is a promising tool for a future quantum internet. Here we present a modification of the quantum PageRank introducing arbitrary phase rotations (APR) in the underlying Szegedy's quantum walk. We define three different APR schemes with only one phase as a degree of freedom. We have analyzed the behavior of the new algorithms in a small generic graph, observing that a decrease of the phase reduces the standard deviation of the instantaneous PageRank, so the nodes of the network can be distinguished better. However, the algorithm takes more time to converge, so the phase can not be decreased arbitrarily. With these results we choose a concrete value for the phase to later apply the algorithm to complex scale-free graphs. In these networks, the original quantum PageRank is able to break the degeneracy of the residual nodes and detect secondary hubs that the classical algorithm suppresses. Nevertheless, not all of the detected secondary hubs are real according to the PageRank's definition. Some APR schemes can overcome this problem, restoring the degeneration of the residual nodes and highlighting the truly secondary hubs of the networks. Finally, we have studied the stability of the new algorithms. The original quantum algorithm was known to be more stable than the classical. We have found that one of our new algorithms whose PageRank distribution resembles the classical one, has a stability similar to the original quantum algorithm.},

            We introduce a new Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with parallel tempering for fitting theoretical models of horizon-scale images of black holes to the interferometric data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT). The algorithm implements forms of the noise distribution in the data that are accurate for all signal-to-noise ratios. In addition to being trivially parallelizable, the algorithm is optimized for high performance, achieving 1 million MCMC chain steps in under 20 s on a single processor. We use synthetic data for the 2017 EHT coverage of M87 that are generated based on analytic as well as General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) model images to explore several potential sources of biases in fitting models to sparse interferometric data. We demonstrate that a very small number of data points that lie near salient features of the interferometric data exert disproportionate influence on the inferred model parameters. We also show that the preferred orientations of the EHT baselines introduce significant biases in the inference of the orientation of the model images. Finally, we discuss strategies that help identify the presence and severity of such biases in realistic applications.},

Updated throughout, the book focuses on core topics including Grover's algorithm and the most important quantum walk models, such as the coined, continuous-time, and Szedgedy's quantum walk models. There is a new chapter describing the staggered quantum walk model. The chapter on spatial search algorithms has been rewritten to offer a more comprehensive approach and a new chapter describing the element distinctness algorithm has been added. There is a new appendix on graph theory highlighting the importance of graph theory to quantum walks. As before, the reader will benefit from the pedagogical elements of the book, which include exercises and references to deepen the reader's understanding, and guidelines for the use of computer programs to simulate the evolution of quantum walks. Review of the first edition: "The book is nicely written, the concepts are introduced naturally, and many meaningful connections between them are highlighted. The author proposes a series of exercises that help the reader get some working experience with the presented concepts, facilitating a better understanding.
